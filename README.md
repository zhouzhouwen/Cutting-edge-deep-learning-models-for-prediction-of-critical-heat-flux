# Perspective and development of cutting-edge deep learning models for prediction of critical heat flux

Abstract
Critical Heat Flux (CHF) plays a pivotal role in ensuring reliability and safety within two-phase flow boiling systems. Despite numerous CHF prediction tools developed using conventional empirical correlations, machine learning, and deep learning methods, the intricate mechanisms of CHF—particularly its sensitivity to flow conditions and heat transfer surfaces—pose a challenge for creating a unified, accurate, and robust prediction model. The complexity is further exacerbated by varying experimental conditions and data over decades of research. This work aims to address these challenges by leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning approaches, including artificial neural networks (ANN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), Transformer, and transfer learning techniques. The proposed artificial intelligence (AI)-based CHF prediction model, particularly the Transformer model employing self-attention mechanisms, dynamically assigns importance to different parts of the input data, significantly improving the model's capability to CHF prediction. The results indicate that the overall CHF predictive performance of Transformer-based AI model surpasses Look-Up Table (LUT) method and benchmark model from the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA). Additionally, the AI-based CHF prediction model's physical behaviors were examined and compared with the LUT method. This comparison confirmed the model's resistance to overfitting. Finally, utilizing transfer learning, the model's ability to predict CHF in tubes was effectively extended to annulus and plate geometries, showcasing the flexibility and robustness of AI-based CHF prediction.
